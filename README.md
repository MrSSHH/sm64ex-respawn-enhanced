# 🎮 SM64EX Respawn Enhanced
## PISS ON THE MOON - Take Control of Your Destiny

Ever wanted to **defy death itself** in Super Mario 64? This mod doesn't just tweak gameplay it fundamentally transforms how you interact with danger, damage, and defeat.

### 🌟 What Makes This Different

**You are no longer bound by the game's rules.** When Mario takes damage, the game wants to send you flying. When you die, the game wants to respawn you at predetermined checkpoints. Not anymore.

This mod gives you **complete autonomy** over the respawn system. You decide when to respawn on death. You decide how far knockback sends you flying. You control the experience.

## ⚡ Features

### 🎯 Customizable Knockback System
- **Adjustable knockback strength** (default: 3000 for explosive launches)
- **Real-time control** via `/knockback [value]` command
- Want to barely flinch when hit? Set it low. Want to be launched into orbit? Crank it up.

### 💀 Respawn Override
- **Toggle death respawning** with `/spawn on` or `/spawn off`
- When enabled: **You respawn exactly where you died** by pressing B when bubbled
- No more trudging back from distant checkpoints
- Perfect for practicing difficult sections, speedrunning, or just refusing to lose progress
- Admin gets called out for being either a "Pussy ass" or "BASED ass" depending on their choice

### 🎭 Admin Flavor
- Delightfully toxic admin messages to keep things spicy
- Because power should come with personality
